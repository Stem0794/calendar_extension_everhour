# Managing Projects

Projects can be reordered and grouped directly from the Settings tab.

1. Click the arrow buttons to change a project's position.
2. Use the **Group** field to organize projects under a custom label.
3. Drag projects into groups for easier tracking.

Move arrows are hidden at group boundaries to prevent crossing groups inadvertently.
